## Task 1

After creating **arrayManipulation.js** we were to create a function [**processArray**](arrayManipulation.js#L19) that takes:
**Inputs**

- an array of numbers
**Outputs**

- Squares even numbers
- Cubes odd numbers

to achieve this I used the modulo function to check if the number is divisible by 2.
*Even numbers are divisible by 2 while odd numbers aren't and leave a remainder*

## Task 2

In the **arrayManipulation.js file, I was asked to create a function [**formatArrayStrings**](./arrayManipulation.js#L33) that takes:
**Inputs**

- An array of Strings
- the array of numbers processed by [**processArray**](./arrayManipulation.js#L19)

It then modifies the string array based on the corresponding index as:
**Outputs**

- Even numbers are capitalized
- Odd numbers are made lowercased

## Task 3

I was asked to create a file **userInfo.js** with function [**createUserProfiles**](./userInfo.js#L16) that takes:
**Inputs**

- An array of names
**Outputs**
- An array of objects with the following properties:
- id
- originalName
- modifiedName
